_______________________
Please run Main function to compute alpha and b to generate 
discriminate function.Then bring xtest and xtrain can get
test kernel.
mode 1 is linear with hardmargin
mode 2 is polynomial with hardmargin with p=[2 3 4 5]
mode 3 is polynomial with hardmargin with p=[2 3 4 5]
       and c=[0.1 0.6 1.1 2.1]
mode 4 is linear with softmargin c=2.1

Kernel.m using by Main function to compute 4 kinds of kernel
(linear with hardmargin),(polynomial with hardmargin)£¬
(polynomial with softmargin) and (linear with softmargin)

Preprocessing.m using by Main function to preprocessing the 
the data by mapping into [-1,1]

FindSupport.m using by Main function to find support vector 
to compute w and b
